# Computational Constructivism

## Overview of files

- `complete_vizualizations_all_trial.zip` -- As in Examples below, but for every participant and trial. 
- `data_fresps_coded_and_encoded_first_coder.csv` -- All free response text + first coder's categorizations of responses + translations into lambda calculus
- `data_fresps_coded_second_coder.csv` -- All free response text + second coder's categorizations of responses + translations of 15% into lambda calculus
- `data_fresps_disagreements.csv` -- The subset of rules that coder 1 and coder 2 categorized differently
- `data_fresps_disagreements_resolved.csv` -- The resolved code for each of these rules.
- `results_processed.rdata` -- Rdata file containing all main results in data frames: `ch.s`: subjectwise data (one line per participant); `ch.r`: rulewise data one line per rule per participant); `ch.fr`: as ch.r but including column for free responses; `ch.t`: testwise data (one line per self generated scene during learning; `ch.o`: objectwise data, one line for each object in each scene for each test for each participant.
